# Text-Editor
A text editor programmed with Python and PyQt5 with integration to Microsoft Word.
# üõ´Get started
This repository contains the code for a simple text editor implemented in Python. The text editor allows users to open, save, and export files, as well as apply formatting such as bold, italic, and underline. This post provides instructions on how to test the text editor.
To test the text editor, follow these steps:
- [ ] **¬©Ô∏èlone the repository**
      <br> Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine: <br>
    ```git clone https://github.com/SchBenedikt/Text-Editor.git```
- [ ] **‚å®Ô∏è Install the dependencies** <br>
      Navigate to the cloned repository and install the required dependencies by running the following command: <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- [ ] **üéâ Run the text editor**<br>
      Execute the main Python script to launch the text editor application:<br>
      ```python text_editor.py```
      
# [‚ùáÔ∏èFeatures](https://github.com/SchBenedikt/Text-Editor/wiki/Features)
The text editor window will open, allowing you to perform various operations. You can open existing files, save files, and export files as DOCX documents. Additionally, you can apply formatting to the text, such as bold, italic, and underline.

## üìÇ file operations
Click on the "File" menu to access options like opening a file and saving a file. Try opening an existing text file and verify that its content is loaded into the text editor. Then, make some changes and save the file to confirm that the modifications are persisted.

## üñäÔ∏è formatting options
Click on the "Format" menu to apply formatting to the selected text. Try selecting some text and clicking on the "Bold," "Italic," or "Underline" options to apply the respective formatting. Verify that the selected text is formatted correctly.

## üíæ export as DOCX
Click on the "File" menu and choose the "Export as DOCX" option. Select a location to save the exported DOCX file and confirm that the file is created successfully. Open the exported file in a word processing application to ensure that the formatting is preserved.

That's it! You have now tested the text editor and verified its functionality. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements.

For any issues or further assistance, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy testing!
